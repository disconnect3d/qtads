<h2 align="left"><a name="About"></a>About</h2>
<p align="left">QTads is a GUI interpreter for <a href="http://www.tads.org">Tads</a> 
  games, running under Unix-based systems (it has been tested in Linux, Mac OS 
  X and FreeBSD, but it should compile and run in many more, like Solaris and 
  Irix). Tads is a programming language for implementing Interactive Fiction (text-adventures). 
  If you ever played an Infocom game like &#8220;Zork&#8221; or &#8220;Trinity&#8221;, 
  or the classic game &#8220;Adventure&#8221; by Crowther and Woods (also known 
  as &#8220;ADVENT&#8221;; it has also been ported to Tads), then you know what 
  this is about.</p>
<p align="left">The Tads compiler generates executables that run on the Tads Virtual 
  Machine; much like Java. QTads is such a virtual machine; it runs Tads executables. 
  Some Tads games use graphics and sound (Multimedia Tads), but QTads doesn't 
  support that yet. You can play these games with QTads, but you won't see graphics 
  or hear sounds. Only a subset of Multimedia Tads is supported (text-formatting 
  effects and HTML character entities). On the plus-side, QTads supports more 
  HTML tags than most other text-only interpreters.</p>
<p align="left"> Since QTads uses <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a>'s 
  Qt library for its user interface, it should be easy to port to other platforms 
  as well, including Windows and embedded devices (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) It 
  supports Tads 2 as well as Tads 3 games (although the Tads 3 support is somewhat 
  half-assed, because it lacks banners). A multimedia-enabled version for HTML 
  Tads games will be available Real Soon Now&#153; (which means somewhere between 
  next month, next year, or next century). Note though, that this will be a different 
  interpreter; QTads itself will remain text-only.</p>
<p align="left">QTads has a rather nice feature that none of the available Multimedia 
  Tads interpreters can provide: text justification. This is only possible in 
  non-Multimedia interpreters and is, more or less, the main reason QTads has 
  been written.</p>
<p align="left">QTads is known to compile with Qt 3.1 and above. You also need 
  a good C++ compiler. GCC versions 2.95.x and above are known to work. (I recommend 
  GCC 3.2 and higher.) Although it hasn't been tested yet, Project Builder in 
  Mac OS X should work. Other compilers should work as well, by the way.</p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Features"></a>Features</font></h2>
<p align="left">Here are some common and uncommon features of QTads:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Unicode support for Tads 3 and full support for Tads 2 character mapping 
    files; you can play games written in any language.</li>
  <li>Text-color support for Tads 3 games.</li>
  <li>Configurable text justification.</li>
  <li>Configurable themes; you can save your settings (colors, fonts, etc) in 
    &#8220;Themes&#8221; and switch them at runtime.</li>
  <li> Multimedia Tads Character Entity support, which means that typographical 
    quotes, dashes and other special characters are available in both Tads 3 as 
    well as Tads 2.</li>
  <li>Curly apostrophes and em-dashes in every game, even if the game doesn't 
    support this (can be disabled).</li>
  <li>Configurable margins (dead space to the left and right).</li>
  <li>Fullscreen mode without switching resolution, with removable menu-, tool- 
    and scrollbar.</li>
  <li>Internationalization; as of now, the GUI is available in English and German.</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Download"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Download</font></h2>
<!--
<p align="left">Note that although binaries are provided for download, it's usually 
  better to compile the interpreter from source, especially when the KDE 3 support 
  doesn't seem to work or the word-wrapping in games is broken. An exception is 
  Mac OS X; just get the binary (if available), and you're done. It should work 
  &#8220;out of the box.&#8221; Another exception are SuSE Linux 9.1 systems; if 
  you're using such a system, the Qt 3.3.x binary should work just fine.</p>
-->
<h3 align="left"><a name="Debian"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Debian</font></h3>
<p align="left">Debian packages can be downloaded from your nearest Debian mirror,
  but the version provided is usually very old. You might be able to find a newer
  version in IFiction-FR (see below.)</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Gentoo"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gentoo</font></h3>
<p align="left">Gentoo Linux users can usually find the most recent version either in
  Portage or in the &#8220;interactive-fiction&#8221; overlay which is accessible with the &#8220;layman&#8221;
  utility: &#8220;layman -L&#8221; followed by &#8220;layman -a interactive-fiction&#8221;. You can then &#8220;emerge qtads&#8221;. Note that the version in the overlay is keyworded as ~arch so you will have
  to keyword it in your package.keywords first.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Mandriva"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mandriva</font></h3>
<p align="left">Mandriva packages can be downloaded from your nearest mandriva mirror. Depending
  on your Mandriva version, you'll find the latest QTads either in contrib/release, contrib/updates
  or contrib/backports.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Sources"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sources</font></h3>
<p align="left">Both *.bz2 as well as *.gz compressed tar archives are provided. 
  Since bz2 compresses better, this is what you should choose to minimize download
  time. The gz compressed archives are provided just in case you don't have the
  bzip2/bunzip2 utility installed.</p>
<p align="left">Here you can only download the most current version of QTads. 
  For past releases, visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtads">Project
  Page</a>.</p>

<p align="left">Here are some screenshots of QTads v1.8 running in KDE 3. (Note

  KDE. But if you happen to use KDE 3, QTads will support it natively, as can 
  be seen in the screenshots below.) You can click on the images to enlarge or

<p align="left">The QTads distribution doesn't contain games, but fear not! There's 
  a large repository for IF-related stuff (with <i>lots</i> of games!) called 
  <a href="http://mirror.ifarchive.org">The Interactive Fiction Archive</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Since the archive is actually just a (huge) bunch of data thrown 
  together (more or less), a nice fellow has created a site that will guide you 
  through the archive. The site is called <a href="http://wurb.com/if">Baf's Guide 
  to the IF Archive</a> and contains many cool things, like a &#8220;Genre Map&#8221; 
  for the games located in the archive along with descriptions, reviews and ratings, 
  links, and other useful things. Make sure to check it out!</p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Community"></a>Community</font></h2>
<p align="left">Interactive Fiction is alive and kicking! New games are released 
  all the time. Some of them are even better that Infocom or Legend classics.</p>
<p align="left">There are two Usenet newsgroups for IF related things. The first 
  is RGIF, which is short for:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="news:rec.games.int-fiction">rec.games.int-fiction</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where people are talking about IF games in general; things they like in games, 
  things they don't like, things they hope to see in future games, requests for 
  hints and solutions, reviews of games, announcements of new games/software or 
  happenings, stuff like that.</p>
<p>The other newsgroup is RAIF, which stands for:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="news:rec.arts.int-fiction">rec.arts.int-fiction</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This newsgroup is for everyone who is interested in creating games. Most IF 
  authors use to hang around there, so this newsgroup is an excellent place to 
  post questions about IF theory or authorship (like programming questions).</p>
